# Charles Paz Yahtzee Project (Python)
***
*This project was created as part of a final exam during BCIT CST's COMP 1510 Course

This is an implementation of the classic Yahtzee! board game in Python! The result is a terminal program in which users can input values to play the entire Yahtzee! game with two people only using a Numpad!

## Usage

As mentioned earlier, this program is meant to run in the terminal, and users are supposed to input numbers in order to make certain decisions during the Yahtzee! gameplay. Messages will be printed to give users information throughout the game and the final score will be calculated and displayed at the end of the program. The rules taken into consideration to make the game derive from the Yahtzee Wikipedia page. Enjoy playing Yahtzee!
